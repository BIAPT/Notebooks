    "## Definition\n",
    "This metric was introduced by Casali et al. in 2013. It is used with TMS stimulation to have a metric describing the brain response to the stimuli complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The metric definition is the Lempel-Ziv complexity of a stream of '0' and '1' scaled by the source entropy and the length of the sequence. This get the metric between 0 and 1 where 1 is when the stream of data is maximally complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCI = (Lempel-Ziv Complexity) x (log(Length of stream,base 2)/(Length of stream x Source Entropy)\n",
    "\n",
    "Source Entropy = -p*log(p, base 2) - (1-p)*log(1-p, base 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "p = fractions of 1 in stream\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "The core of the algorithm being the Lempel-Ziv complexity we need to have a solid implementation of that. We can use my previous code in the Lempel-Ziv Jupyter notebook, however its safer to use a battle-tested implementation. One good implementation that I have found is this one: https://github.com/Naereen/Lempel-Ziv_Complexity. \n",
    "To install it we need to use pip as shown in the README.md `pip install lempel_ziv_complexity`."
